We perform the division of each product with $m$ and get $ak=p_km+r_k$. Now, if two different integers $k,l\\in\\mathcal{Z}_m$ had the same remainder, i.e. if $r_k=r_l$, then $ak-p_km=al-p_lm$, hence $a(k-l)=(p_k-p_l)m$.

If we have $m$ unique remainders that can only take the values $0,1,...,m-1$, this means that according to the pigeonhole principle they take on all these values, thus there exists one $k\\in\\mathcal{Z}_m$, such that $p_k=1$, which is the unique inverse element.\n",
